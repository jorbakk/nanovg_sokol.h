    Embedded shader source code follows below.

    Notes:

    There are two main shader files included below:
    - shd.glsl
    - shd.aa.glsl

    as well as the following two support files that are included by the main files:
    - internal_shd.fs.glsl
    - internal_shd.vs.glsl

    To extract all four shader source code files back use the following awk command:

    awk '/^8< / {out_file=$2; print "// " out_file > out_file; next} /^>8/ {out_file=""; next} {if (out_file) print $0 >> out_file}' nanovg_sokol.h

    You can then use the sokol shader compiler to compile the shader code into
    a include (.h) file using the following commands;

    sokol-shdc --input shd.glsl --output shd.glsl.h --slang glsl410:glsl300es:hlsl4:metal_macos:metal_ios:metal_sim:wgsl --ifdef
    sokol-shdc --input shd.aa.glsl --output shd.aa.glsl.h --defines=EDGE_AA --slang glsl410:glsl300es:hlsl4:metal_macos:metal_ios:metal_sim:wgsl --ifdef

    The sokol-shdc tool from this commit was used to compile it:
    https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools-bin/commit/339ff0314f19414c248cd540b7c72de1873f3a4b

    After you compiled the shader source code to the include files you can
    either replace the files below or use the following awk to do this
    automatically:

    awk '/\/\/ -- START --/ {print $0; getline; file=substr($3, 2, length($3)-2); print $0; next} /\/\/ -- END --/ {print $0; file=""; next} {if (!file) { print $0 } else { while((getline line < file) > 0) { print line } }}' nanovg_sokol.h > nanovg_sokol.h.new

    This will create a file "nanovg_sokol.h.new" which should be the new
    nanovg_sokol.h.
